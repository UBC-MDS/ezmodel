# Contributing

We use the branching strategy outlined [here](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) for this project. Outside contributors are welcome,
and are welcome to fork the repository and create a pull request to contribute. All contributions should include at least one unit test. For example, in Python, a
function such as the one that follows should be included,

```Python
if __name__ == __main__:
  def unit_test(func_args):
    assert added_function(func_args) == expected_output()

  unit_test(func_args)
```

All contributors are required to follow the [Code of Conduct](ADD LINK HERE) and any behaviour otherwise will not be tolerated.
